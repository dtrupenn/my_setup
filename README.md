# My Setup 

## Purpose
This is a collection of scripts meant to help setup mostly vanilla tooling and specific configuration that is catered to the way that I prefer to develop. These scripts are targeted to work with Linux (mostly RedHat and Debian based systems) and OSX.

## TODO
- Add proper CI to ensure validity of scripts
- Add testing story
- Ensure testing for OSX
